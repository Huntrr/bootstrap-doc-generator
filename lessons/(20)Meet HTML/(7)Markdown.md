Oh look. Markdown is supported too! (this file is in markdown)

Test of a new paragraph.

```
test code
var this = 'is not real code';
i mean i didn’t give it a language
so it defaults to ‘c-like’
```

Now I'm gonna do real code. But first a [link](http://test.com)

```js
var some = 'javascript code';
var x = 3;
var xSquared = x * x;
```

I wonder what it thinks of `inline code`?

Also, lists:

1. Hello
1. How are you?
1. Hmmm cool!

Unnumbered:

- One
- Two
- Three

_because why not?_
