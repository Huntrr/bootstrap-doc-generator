        <p>Welcome to Code Weekend! We're a series a workshops run by
          The Dining Philosophers and the Architechs aimed at getting
          Penn students with none-to-some coding experience ready for PennApps.
          Anyone can follow along online—we've made these series of web
          development tutorials free for everyone—but students can also sign
        up below and register to attend the workshops in person.</p>

<p>Code Weekend is scheduled for <em>???????</em> and will comprise of four workshops to help participants build their very own webapp. Participants are expected to have very minimal coding experience as we will be carefully explaining everything we do as we go. This should be extremely helpful to first time hackers (a fun term we use for people that build things!) especially with <a href="http://pennapps.com" title="PennApps XIII">PennApps</a> scheduled for the weekend after. If you haven&#39;t already, check it out - it&#39;s a great way to jump in the deep end and expose yourself to the incredible world of building things (and actually they&#39;re doing great stuff for first-time hackers as well).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These workshops have been organized by the Dining Philosophers, PennApps and many talented individuals. Student mentors will be around to help participants as we go through these highly interactive, live-coding-based workshops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you already have some coding experience, then feel free to skip the first session. Here&#39;s what we expect you to know and have installed before you jump into the second session:</p>
<ul>
<li>The basics of how the web works.</li>
<li>HTML/CSS/Javascript to the extent that you can build a simple static webpage.</li>
<li>Know how to use Terminal/Command Prompt to move folders, change directories, and create files.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You can find the workshops from the last Code Weekend (Fall 2015) <a href="http://BROKEN-LINK.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Alright, let&#39;s get started!</p>
</div><span id="sec-2-2" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>An Introduction to (the) Life (of a Developer)</h3><p>When coding, you&#39;ll run into tons of small problems and errors that you don&#39;t initially know how to solve. <strong><em>This is completely normal.</em></strong> In order to write solutions to every problem that you could hypothetically run into, you&#39;d need a manual taller than the Empire State building. </p>
<p>Thankfully, we all have a resource with more information that we can possibly imagine - teh interwebz. You&#39;ve probably searched for things using Google before, but most coding problems can actually be solved by effectively Googling your issue. Here are some tips for finding the answers to all your problems on the Internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be descriptive. If you&#39;re searching for what&#39;s causing an error then you can try just searching for the entire error message, or try describing what happened. For example, &quot;Homebrew does not install through terminal on OSX Yosemite&quot; is a better search query than &quot;homebrew not working&quot;, though the best search query is often some combination of plain text and the actual error message. Often error codes make great search queries, as long as they are contextualized (i.e. with the name of the language/environment).</li>
<li>Along that vein, use as many specific words as possible. You can use complete sentences if you&#39;d like, but normally four or five very descriptive nouns/verbs is ideal, and you won&#39;t throw Google off-track by searching for unnecessary things. For example, you try to put a banner at the top of a web page, but there&#39;s a weird white border around the entire page. Googling &quot;there&#39;s a weird white border around the entire page&quot; isn&#39;t helpful. Always start with the name of the language you think is suspect if you can (in this case, it&#39;s CSS, since all style things on the page are controlled by CSS). Then, describe the problem with just a few words. Here, I used &quot;CSS no page border&quot;. The first result was really helpful, and ended up solving my problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>These resources are also awesome:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> is the best. Search results that link here are often the most helpful, and you can almost always find someone who&#39;s had the same problem as you on here. You should mostly refrain from posting questions to Stack Overflow since odds are your question has already been answered there somewhere.</li>
<li>If you&#39;re looking for syntax, or lists of inbuilt functions, then look for the Official Documentation for the language in question. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3C Schools</a> is great for HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bento.io">Bentobox</a> is a great all-in-one resource to learn to code for a huge number of technologies. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">Code Academy</a> has some great tutorials. The lessons for each language can get tedious, but the tutorials where you build actual things are pretty great. If you&#39;re looking for a good introduction to HTML/CSS, <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly&#39;s Dash</a> is probably the best place to start.</li>
</ul>
</div><span id="sec-2-3" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>An Introduction to the web</h3><p>There&#39;s pretty much three things happening every time you open a website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your browser looks up an address (say google.com) and follows it back to its home - the server which actually runs the website. This server is basically just a computer, albeit a huge, immensely powerful computer possibly comprising acres of computer hardware connected together. For this workshop though, that&#39;s just going to be your laptop...we don&#39;t provide that kind of computing power.</li>
<li>This server is what we call the <em>backend</em>. This server now processes your request - it could be a request to view the website or something more complicated like an attempt to log in to a dashboard - and sends a response back to your computer. This server will often be programmed in languages such as Python, Ruby on Rails, even Java (but not as much these days). Node.JS is a framework that lets us use Javascript on the backend as well as the frontend.</li>
<li>Your computer now reads this response and converts it into the webpage you actually see on your computer. This last bit of conversion is what we call the <em>frontend</em> doing its work.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="assets/img/server-browser.png" alt="Server- Browser"></p>
<p>So basically, any work done on a server has been programmed into the backend, while anything done inside your browser has been programmed into the frontend. These are the two main components of any website.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll see later on that requests aren&#39;t just made to the server when we first open the website; it&#39;s often faster to make smaller requests first, load the important parts of a webpage and then request additional bits of information when they&#39;re needed (think <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook&#39;s Newsfeed</a>). It&#39;s also used when we do things like attempt to log in to a website. This is one of the reasons why Javascript is so useful as a frontend programming language, as it allows us to do these kinds of things very easily and update the webpage immediately without having to refresh the page.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.product-reviews.net/wp-content/uploads/facebook-not-working.jpg" alt="Facebook Loading using Javascript"></p>
</div><span id="sec-2-4" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>What is Terminal&#47;Command Prompt?</h3><p><img src="assets/img/terminal.png" alt="Terminal"></p>
<p>Terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) is basically a way for us to access the Command Line. This gives us access to a wonderful variety of things that we can do. We will be spending a good amount of time this weekend in here, so let&#39;s take some time to get used to it.</p>
<p>Once you fire up Terminal or Command Prompt (on Windows, you&#39;ll later need to run cmd.exe by right clicking on the shortcut and clicking Run as Administrator, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s running as Admin if your path ends in <code>../system32</code>), here are a few simple commands that you can type:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ls</code> (<code>DIR</code> on Windows) lists all the files in the current folder</li>
<li><code>cd</code> allows you to change directory. So <code>cd Documents</code> will move into the folder Documents, if there is such a folder in the current directory. You can check this by using <code>ls</code> (<code>DIR</code> on windows). To move up a directory, say back to where you were before you went into Documents, type in <code>cd ../</code>.</li>
<li><code>pwd</code> prints out the current path you&#39;ve traversed in the file system. It&#39;s particularly helpful once you&#39;ve used <code>cd</code> a few times, and aren&#39;t sure where you are anymore.</li>
<li><code>mkdir</code> allows you to make a folder in the current directory. So <code>mkdir Such Magic</code> makes a folder named &#39;Such Magic&#39;.</li>
<li><code>mv</code> (<code>move</code> on windows) will let you move files and folders. In Terminal you can do <code>mv ~/Desktop/MyFile.rtf /Volumes/Backup/MyFolder</code> to move MyFile.rtf. On Windows <code>move c:\windows\temp\*.* c:\temp</code> will move everything from <code>C:\windows\temp</code> to <code>C:\temp</code>. <code>*</code> works as a wildcard operator here. Careful with this one - you may not want to move things around haphazardly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#39;ve installed Node.JS (which we&#39;ll do in the next workshop), you&#39;ll also be able to enter commands like <code>npm install express</code> that will use Node Package manager to install plugins such as Express. You&#39;ll aso be able to start up MongoDB from here using <code>mongod</code>.</p>
<h3 id="let-s-start-making-stuff-">Let&#39;s start making stuff!</h3>
<p>Whoohoo! We&#39;ve made it this far, and it&#39;s finally time to start making stuff!</p>
<h4 id="sublime-text-2">Sublime Text 2</h4>
<p>We&#39;ve got to install a whole buch of stuff over the next few workshops. Let&#39;s start simple, go and download <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>. It&#39;s the best text editor in existence (yes, that&#39;s arguable) and this is where we&#39;re gonna be doing all our work. If you have a different favorite text editor, feel free to use it.</p>
<p>NOTE: Sometimes, when you save your work, a window will pop up asking you to buy Sublime. Just ignore this and hit &quot;Cancel&quot; and you can use it forever. Alternatively, you can buy it and support a fellow developer.</p>
<h3 id="making-a-personal-landing-page">Making a Personal Landing Page</h3>
<p>Well done! You&#39;ve got everything you need installed. Now let&#39;s test what you&#39;ve learned in this workshop. Here&#39;s an <a href="assets/files/sample.html">HTML</a> and a <a href="assets/files/main.css">CSS</a> file. Try and use this as a base to create your own personal landing page. The adventurous ones among you can even try and create a complete static website; you know enough that you can just Google for anything you need. Take a look at some of our organizers&#39; websites for inspiration (<a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu">Devesh</a>, <a href="http://dhruvagarwal.me">Dhruv</a>) or browse around the internet to see nice designs (like <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>).</p>
<h4 id="files">Files</h4>
<p>You can download the <a href="assets/files/sample.html">HTML</a> and <a href="assets/files/main.css">CSS</a> files we looked at here by following these links. Use these as starting points for building your personal landing pages.</p>
</div></section><span id="sec-3" class="anchor"></span><section id="" class="group"><div class="page-header"><h2> Workshop 1, HTML&#47;CSS</h2></div><span id="sec-3-1" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>Simple HTML and CSS</h3><p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any webpage. It&#39;s where we add in all the information - what the webpage actually displays, as well as information about the page itself such as its title.</p>
<p><img src="http://static.webplatform.org/w/public/6/6e/article4.gif" alt="With and without CSS"></p>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) dresses up this information. Most (but really all) webpages link to a CSS file that stores information on how a browser should display the information it recieves in the HTML. While it is possible to add CSS code into the HTML document, it is never done as it makes it nearly impossible to keep track of code and also slows down the page.</p>
<p>Javascript is the fun part. It does dynamic things with your webpage, updates content on the fly and can animate just about anything. We&#39;ll talk about this later.</p>
<p>In short, we can visualize it as follows: a full website is a program with raw structure defined via HTML, dressed up with CSS and controlled/manipulated with JavaScript.</p>
<p>Every webpage is built in the HTML DOM (Document Object Model). This means that every element in the HTML is an element (or a Node, the mathematical kind - not to be confused with Node.JS). So we could call this paragraph an element in the DOM; the same is true of any of the images and pretty much everything else here.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with HTML (HyperText Markup Language).</p>
<p><img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4fl5qPjdU1rw659vo1_400.png" alt="HTML meme"></p>
<p>HyperText is text that will hyperlink you to other text. That&#39;s it. Think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">links</a>.</p>
<p>It is called a Markup Language because HTML is not written as plain text. It is marked up into the form of HTML elements called &#39;tags.&#39; Tags are denoted by <code>&lt;</code> followed by <code>&gt;</code>. Below is the most basic HTML document we can create (except for the comments that we&#39;ve added in to make things clearer).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;!-- This, is a comment that does not affect any of the code we write. We can use this to leave notes in the code for our future selves, or for others reading our code. This is also the most basic HTML document you can create. --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Code Weekend Sample Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a basic HTML webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt;</code> is how you should start any HTML file. For every HTML tag that we open, there must be one that closes it. This way we can easily tell what information is contatined in what tag, and it allows for easy nesting. The obvious drawback is that this is highly verbose. For example, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> must eventually be closed by <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Aside from the content rendered into the <em>body</em> of a webpage, we often define more information about the site in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
  &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Code Weekend Sample Page&quot;&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Code Weekend Sample Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;main.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So now we&#39;ve specified the character set that the page uses - this is just to make sure the browser doesn&#39;t think that the page is in a language other than english. Then there&#39;s a description followed by the actual page title (this is what you see in the title bar of your browser). Finally there&#39;s a tag where we&#39;ve linked this HTML file to a CSS document (the <code>href</code> component is how we tell the browser where to look for this file - it can be a path or a web address). This is how we add external CSS files to a webpage - which we&#39;ll do soon enough, don&#39;t worry!</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s get to the fun part - the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. This is where all the actual stuff that shows up on your webpage goes. Let&#39;s try adding some information in.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Code Weekend Sample Page&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Here&#39;s a smaller heading. We can go all the way down to H6&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;!-- Here&#39;s a comment that will not show up on the actual page --&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Here&#39;s a paragraph of text. You can fill in whatever you feel like in here and just end this tag to fininsh the paragraph.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s look at this whole document now.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;!-- This, is a comment that does not affect any of the code we write. We can use this to leave notes in the code for our future selves, or for others reading our code. This is a slightly more compelte HTML document, but still doesn&#39;t have any information about styles. --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Code Weekend Sample Page&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Code Weekend Sample Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;main.css&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Code Weekend Sample Page&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Here&#39;s a smaller heading. We can go all the way down to H6&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;!-- Here&#39;s a comment that will not show up on the actual page --&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here&#39;s a paragraph of text. You can fill in whatever you feel like in here and just end this tag to fininsh the paragraph.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here are some more important HTML tags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;a href=&quot;link here&quot;&gt;text for the link&lt;/a&gt;</code> - used to create links</li>
<li><code>&lt;img src=&quot;path/link to image&quot; alt=&quot;text to show if image doesn&#39;t load&quot; /&gt;</code> - used to add images</li>
<li><code>&lt;em&gt;text here&lt;/em&gt;</code> - used for italicising text</li>
<li><code>&lt;strong&gt;text here&lt;/strong&gt;</code> - used to bold text</li>
<li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> - used to start Unordered and Ordered Lists</li>
<li><code>&lt;li&gt;Item here&lt;/li&gt;</code> - used to denote each item in a list</li>
<li><code>&lt;script&gt; Code in here &lt;/script&gt;</code> - used to add non-HTML code such as Javascript to a page. We can (and should) instead add an <code>src</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and link to an external Javascript file to keep our ccode clean and maintainable.</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> - used to denote different divisions within your HTML body. Possibly one of the most useful tags when it comes to layout and styling in CSS.</li>
</ul>
</div><span id="sec-3-2" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>Umm, what about CSS?</h3><p>Almost there! Before we can decide how elements on the page should look, we actually need a way to find and identify these elements. That HTML document we said was almost complete, well, it was almost complete. The last thing we need to add in are identifiers as <em>tag attributes</em>, and these fall into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>IDs: These are unique to an individual HTML element. Once I give an ID to an element, it cannot be used again. Think Penn IDs. Every element can be assigned an ID. For example: <code>&lt;p id=&quot;workshop-introduction&quot;&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Classes: These are reusable names that we give to ranges of elements. This allows us to do thigns like apply the same style (say, a font) to multiple elements that have the same class, rather than writing the same thing over and over. For example, we can create multiple paragraphs with the same class: <code>&lt;p class=&quot;red-text&quot;&gt; This text is theoretically red.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;red-text&quot;&gt; This text is also presumably red. &lt;/p&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have a way to decide on styles. Let&#39;s look at that HTML document again:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;!-- This is a comment that does not affect any of the code we write. We can use this to leave notes in the code for our future selves, or for others reading our code. This is a slightly more compelte HTML document, but still doesn&#39;t have any information about styles. It however does use identifiers, so we&#39;re one step closer to styling. --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Code Weekend Sample Page&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Code Weekend Sample Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;main.css&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Code Weekend Sample Page&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Here&#39;s a smaller heading. We can go all the way down to H6&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;!-- Here&#39;s a comment that will not show up on the actual page --&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;red-text&quot; id=&quot;intro-para&quot;&gt;
      Here&#39;s a paragraph of text. It&#39;s ID is &#39;intro-para&#39; and it belongs to the &#39;red-text&#39; class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We can also just change the style for an entire kind of element. So we could just change how all the <code>p</code> or <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags look. </p>
</div><span id="sec-3-3" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>Let's take a look at what CSS looks like!</h3><pre><code class="lang-css">body {

<p>As you can see, there are small differences in syntax depending on the selector (whether you&#39;re changing all instances of an element, instances of a class, or just a single element by ID) but it&#39;s mostly quite simple.</p>
<p>You should look through the resources at the top of this section for more information on HTML tags and CSS attributes, but the best thing to do is to Google things you&#39;re looking to do and look for the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3C Schools</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> results.</p>

By scripting language we mean that there are no Classes, Interfaces, Main Methods or any of the regular Object-Oriented Programming that we&#39;re (maybe) used to. You just write code in a file, link to it in your HTML and it exectutes.</p>
</div><span id="sec-4-2" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>In fact...</h3><p><img src="http://www.memegenerator.eu/media/created/iyflyp.jpg" alt="Javascript meme"></p>
<p>Javascript is a very easy language to pick up. There are no types, Javascript just guesses (mostly well) what you want. This means that writing <code>var x = 5</code> will create a variable named <code>x</code> of the type <em>Integer</em> with the value of <code>5</code>. Writing <code>var x = &quot;5&quot;</code> would create a <em>String</em> named <code>x</code> with the string <code>5</code> as its value.</p>
<p>The most common types we will use are Strings (just text, such as &quot;This is some text&quot;), Integers (just plain old numbers, like 5, 6, 42, or 314596 - no decimal points though), Doubles (decimal points are now allowed, so 3.14 is good to go) and Booleans (True or False). There are a whole bunch of functions and operators built into Javascript that we can use on these data-types. You should search for them as and when you need to do something that you think is fairly common (you&#39;ll be surprised by how common almost everything you want to do is).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some sample Javascript code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var myVariable = &quot;Code Weekend&quot;;
alert (&quot;I&#39;m learning the basics of JavaScript at &quot; + myVariable);
</code></pre>
<p>This creates an alert (a pop-up on a webpage) that says &quot;I&#39;m learning the basics of JavaScript at Code Weekend&quot;. There was absolutely no reason to use a variable here other than to show how we can use it. Here&#39;s a function in Javascript that squares a number:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function square (number) {
  return number * number;
}

// This is a single line comment that does not need to be closed.

/* This is a multi-line comment
that only ends when we do this */

console.log(square (5)); // This prints the result to the javascript console in your browser&#39;s (Chrome or Firefox) developer tools.

// We can also write the above function as the following:
var square = function (number) {
  return number * number;
}

// Here&#39;s an anonymous function that calculates the square of 5:
(function (number) {
  return number*number;
}) (5);

// In that case, we were executing the anonymous function immediately, but we don&#39;t have to always do that:
function idPlusString (number) {
  var cube = number * number * number;
  return function (name) {
    return &quot;Hi &quot;+ name + &quot;. &quot; + &quot;Your ID is &quot; + cube + &quot;.&quot;;
  }
}
// This returns a function that you can add a string to. If you don&#39;t understand this last function, it&#39;s okay.
</code></pre>
<p>Javascript mainly works on Objects and Arrays to store and access data.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// Here&#39;s an Object that contains an array
var myDetails = {
  &#39;name&#39; : &quot;Mark Gates&quot;,
  &#39;age&#39; : 24,
  &#39;interests&#39;: [&#39;Figure Skating&#39;, &#39;Javascript&#39;, &#39;Tennis&#39;, &#39;EDM&#39;]
}

console.log(myDetails.name); // prints the name property of the object, ie, &#39;Mark Gates&#39;

console.log(myDetails.interests[1]); // prints &#39;Javascript&#39; (array positions start from 0!) to the console
</code></pre>
<p>Objects are essentially key-value pairs. We can access to values easily using the notation <code>object.key</code>.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t noticed yet, we end almost every line (or more specifically, every command) with a semicolon. It&#39;s okay if you end every line with one, it&#39;s better to err on the side of more rather than less, but you can get away with leaving off the semicolons after function definitions and pretty much everything that ends in curly braces (<code>}</code>).</p>
<p><img src="http://classic.splurd.com/comics/images/1337794967.jpg" alt="Semicolons are death"></p>
<p><em>JSON (Javascript Object Notation)</em> is the data format of the internet. This is what is used to send data that is not HTML/CSS/JS across the internet. That could range from search results to login sessions. Another commonly used format is XML, but that is slowly being replaced everywhere by JSON. JSON is very simple to understand because every JSON file is simply one Javascript Object. It uses key-value pairs and Arrays to liberally to store information. Let&#39;s look at an example of a JSON file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
  &quot;employees&quot;:[
    {
      &quot;firstName&quot;:&quot;John&quot;, 
      &quot;lastName&quot;:&quot;Doe&quot;
    }, 
    {
      &quot;firstName&quot;:&quot;Anna&quot;, 
      &quot;lastName&quot;:&quot;Smith&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;firstName&quot;:&quot;Peter&quot;, 
      &quot;lastName&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;
    }
  ],
  &quot;company&quot; : &quot;ABC Holdings&quot;,
  &quot;lastUpdated&quot; : &quot;September 6th&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s exactly like a Javascript Object, and that&#39;s because that&#39;s exactly what it is. Just for kicks, let&#39;s compare this to XML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;employees&gt;
  &lt;employee&gt;
    &lt;firstName&gt;John&lt;/firstName&gt; 
    &lt;lastName&gt;Doe&lt;/lastName&gt;
  &lt;/employee&gt;
  &lt;employee&gt;
    &lt;firstName&gt;Anna&lt;/firstName&gt; 
    &lt;lastName&gt;Smith&lt;/lastName&gt;
  &lt;/employee&gt;
  &lt;employee&gt;
    &lt;firstName&gt;Peter&lt;/firstName&gt; 
    &lt;lastName&gt;Jones&lt;/lastName&gt;
  &lt;/employee&gt;
&lt;/employees&gt;
&lt;company&gt;ABC Holdings&lt;/company&gt;
&lt;lastUpdated&gt;September 6th&lt;/lastUpdated&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So much better isn&#39;t it! JSON is way more readable and saves you the trouble of having to close every tag you open. Now imagine this on the scale of thousands of search results. JSON makes your life much easier, and websites much faster.</p>
<p>And that covers the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Naturally, there&#39;s a lot more we could go into depth about for each of them, but we&#39;ve found that it&#39;s best to learn by experimenting and trying out things on your own, using the resources listed at the start of this session. But before we get to that, let&#39;s not forget the pertinent question:</p>

</div><span id="sec-7-2" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>Installing MongoDB</h3><p>Let&#39;s move on to MongoDB. Mongo is a NoSQL Database; this means that rather than the data being stored in SQL tables, it&#39;s stored in some other format. In the case of MongoDB, the format is <strong>BSON</strong>, which is a more efficient way of storing JSON. Like other databases, we can store, search and access large amounts of data very quickly.</p>
<p><em>Mac (OS X)</em></p>
<p>Assuming you have Homebrew installed by this point you can just type <code>brew install mongodb</code> into terminal. Then, if all goes well, mongodb should show you three different commands that you should copy-paste into Terminal and run. Before you start mongo for the first time, run <code>mkdir -p /data/db</code> to create the default location for the database.</p>
<p>In case you run into any problems, <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/">look at MongoDB&#39;s full instructions page</a> and Google around before asking mentors for help.</p>
<p><em>Windows</em></p>
<p>MongoDB has a full set of instructions <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/">here</a> that you should follow through till you can run MongoDB. You most probably just need to install the 64-bit version of MongoDB using their installation file. Before you run Mongo for the first time, you&#39;d need to run this from Command Prompt: <code>md \data\db</code>. Follow the instructions on the above link to run MongoDB.</p>
<p><em>Linux</em></p>
<p>Most Linux distros should have MongoDB available for installation in their respective package managers (<code>apt-get</code>, <code>yum</code>, <code>pacman</code>, etc.). Alternately, you can read the full instructions to install MongoDB on Ubuntu can be found <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Before you start mongo for the first time, run <code>mkdir -p /data/db</code> to create the default location for the database.</p>
</div><span id="sec-7-3" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>Running MongoDB</h3><p>Just type in <code>mongod</code> into Terminal before you run your node app. On Windows, you might need to find and double-click the mongod.exe file (it\s probably at <code>C:\Program Files\MongoDB\bin\mongod.exe</code>). This fires up a Mongo instance that will run continously in the background until it&#39;s killed. You only have to run this once to access Mongo databases on your local machine, from any application you make!</p>
</div><span id="sec-7-4" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>Why use a database? And why MongoDB?</h3><p>Databases are these other kinds of web development things, separate from the webapp itself, where all we do is store information. They make it easy to store and access large amounts of data very quickly and efficiently. All important information, such as user accounts, catalogues, prices, wall posts, tweets etc. across any major website, app or anything else that runs on computers probably stores this information in a database.</p>
<p>You may wondering why we should even consider databases when things like cookies exist. After all, we&#39;ve been using those so far, and they work great! However, there are several reasons why databases need to exist, and why, in some scenarios, are far better than cookies.</p>
<p>Firstly, not all information that needs to be stored is relevant to your application&#39;s user, and they probably won&#39;t have enough space on their device to store all of it! Imagine what would happen if Amazon&#39;s entire online catalogue was stored on your iPhone - it&#39;d be a miracle if it even manages to switch on. Cookies are better suited to storing information that&#39;s unique and relevant to a user&#39;s interaction with an application. It&#39;s also crucial that this information is something we can afford to lose - cookies can be deleted in an instance with the &#39;Clear Cookies&#39; option on all web browsers, and some users disable cookies entirely!</p>
<p>Databases let us store information we need, and give us greater control over how it&#39;s handled. Modern databases can store huge amounts of data in several formats, allowing it to be structured, organized and quickly acessible. However, it does mean there&#39;s another layer of trouble that has to be tackled, in dealing with asking our databases for data and sending new data from our web application. This is usually doe through <em>queries</em> to a database.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/9a/9a87002957d106568dcfc2b8135c213b608a268232d7259fbc19d42b831488cd.jpg" alt="Don&#39;t query SQL"></p>
<p>That&#39;s why MongoDB is so popular with NodeJS. While it is still a separate database, all the data that you get from the database is in the 
JSON format. That&#39;s right, just JSON! So when we ask Mongo for results, it can give us an array of javascript objects and that means we don&#39;t have to worry about the formatting of the data, cause it&#39;s already in the format we need! You might hear people argue for (or against) the use of MongoDB because it&#39;s a NoSQL database, but this has a lot of tradeoffs and there&#39;s no clear cut winner between SQL and NoSQL; they&#39;re each suited for different applications.</p>
</div><span id="sec-7-5" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>How MongoDB structures your data</h3><p>Before we go into the details of accessing data stored in the database, let&#39;s first understand <em>how</em> it&#39;s stored. Within a single MongoDB instance (like the one we fired up with the <code>mongod</code> command), it&#39;s possible to create and work with several databases. Within each of these these databases, we store data in <em>collections</em>. Each database holds a set of collections, which in turn store documents. Now, the documents are what we are already familiar with: JSON! In order to uniquely identify each of these documents, Mongo automatically generates a field, <code>_id</code>, populated with an <em>ObjectId</em>. We can find specific documents using either this field, or any other, by generating a search query. (You can also explicitly set the <code>_id</code> field if you&#39;d like, although this isn&#39;t need in most cases)</p>
<p>Just to get this structure down, let&#39;s consider how Twitter data stored in Mongo might look. If we wanted to find the top most trending hashtag in the United States, we&#39;d have to look in the <code>tweets</code> database, inside the <code>trending_hashtags</code> collection. Within this collection there are undoubtedly hundreds of documents representing trending tweets in each country, and so we make a query to search for a Document with a field <code>country: &#39;United States&#39;</code>. Like magic, Mongo will return us this document and we can parse it to find a list of hashtags trending in the country, and subsequently the topmost one.</p>
<p><img src="assets/img/trending.png" alt="Trending hashtags"></p>
<p>It&#39;s an incredibly powerful method of storing and accessing your data and it often turns out to be suprisingly efficient as well.</p>
</div><span id="sec-7-6" class="anchor"></span><div id="" class="subgroup"><h3>Integrating MongoDB into the web app</h3><p>We&#39;re now going to integrate a MongoDB database into our application to store data. As said earlier, Mongo is a document database (basically the entire thing is one JSON document) that provides high performance, high availability and easy scalability. The first thing we&#39;re going to have to do is add MongoDB to our dependencies list inside of <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>TIP:</em> Think back to what the dependencies section of the <code>package.json</code> is for! Also, isn&#39;t it cool how all we need to do to include all the source code for handling MongoDB is by requiring a new module? This is one of the reasons why NodeJS is so popular!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add &quot;mongodb&quot;: &quot;~1.4.19&quot; to the dependencies object inside the JSON so that it looks a little like this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
&quot;name&quot;: &quot;codeweekend&quot;,
&quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.0&quot;,
&quot;private&quot;: true,
&quot;dependencies&quot;: {
&quot;body-parser&quot;: &quot;~1.6.6&quot;,
&quot;cookie-parser&quot;: &quot;~1.3.3&quot;,
&quot;cookie-session&quot;: &quot;~1.0.2&quot;,
&quot;express&quot;: &quot;~4.8.6&quot;,
&quot;hjs&quot;: &quot;~0.0.6&quot;,
&quot;mongodb&quot;: &quot;~1.4.19&quot;,
&quot;request&quot;: &quot;^2.42.0&quot;
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now let&#39;s go to <code>routes.js</code>. Just like any other module, we first need to require <code>mongodb</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var mongo = require(&#39;mongodb&#39;);
</code></pre>
<p>Next, let&#39;s add the following code to open a connection to the database:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var db;
var MongoClient = mongo.MongoClient;
var uri = &quot;mongodb://localhost:27017/codeweekend&quot;;

MongoClient.connect(uri, function(err, database) {
if (err) {
throw err;
}

db = database;
});
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing we need to do is declare a variable for the database to be stored in (we&#39;ll see why in a minute). We also store the MongoClient object in a helper variable.</p>
<p>Next, we store the connection string in a variable. The connection string looks complicated, so let&#39;s break it down into parts. The beginning of any connection string for MongoDB is always &quot;mongodb://&quot;. Next, you put the server name, a colon, and then the port number to connect to. In our case, since we&#39;re running the database on the same computer as the Node app, we can just use &quot;localhost&quot;. The port number, 27017, is just the default port that <code>mongod</code> listens on; we didn&#39;t specify a different port when we ran <code>mongod</code> before, so that&#39;s where ours is listening. Finally, the string ends with a slash and then the name of the database to connect to. You can pick whatever name you&#39;d like for the database; it&#39;s just a way of identifying which one you want to connect to in the case that you have multiple databases on your server. This also demonstrates one of the really nice features of MongoDB; if you specify a database that doesn&#39;t already exist, then it will create it for you.</p>
<p>Finally, we connect to the database using the connection string we&#39;ve defined. Notice that the function <code>connect</code> actually takes a callback rather than returning the database directly. This can useful in some cases, since it allows your app to do other things while waiting for the database to connect. In our case, though, we just want to be able to use the database outside the callback, which is why we declared the <code>db</code> variable earlier.</p>
<p>In practice, you&#39;ll want to handle your errors more gracefully—meaning your app should do something other than just crash! For the purposes of this demo, though, it&#39;s simpler just to throw the error you get when trying to connect to the database. If your app crashes when you try to run it after adding this section, make sure that you have <code>mongod</code> running in an open terminal, and try again.</p>
<p>We also need to make a helper variable for the function <code>ObjectID</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var ObjectID = mongo.ObjectID;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let&#39;s really get our hands messy and change our existing code to make use of the powerful database we now have access to.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">router.get(&#39;/&#39;, function(req, res) {
return res.render(&#39;index&#39;, {
title: &#39;Codeweekend Notes&#39;,
notes: req.session.notes
});
});
</code></pre>
<p>We already know that this stores our notes in a session. However, now, let&#39;s make use of that database we&#39;ve been talking about so much! With a little change in how we access and store the notes object, we can now route the entire process through our DB. We&#39;re going to make use of <em>queries</em> in the following sections, which are basically different ways of searching for data in a database. Naturally, each database allows you to create and use queries differently, and <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/mongodb_query_document.htm">this</a> is how Mongo does some of the more popular ones.</p>
<p>First, assuming we&#39;ve stored all of the notes into a collection called <code>notes</code> inside of the <code>codeweekend</code> database, let&#39;s render all of the notes in the database for the route &#39;/&#39;.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var ObjectID = require(&#39;mongodb&#39;).ObjectID;

router.get(&#39;/&#39;, function(req, res) {
db.collection(&#39;notes&#39;).find().toArray(function(err, notes) {
return res.render(&#39;index&#39;, {
title: &#39;Codeweekend Notes&#39;,
notes: notes
});
});
});
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>find</code> query returns all the documents in the collection, and the <code>toArray</code> method parses them all into an array, so that they can be rendered as before onto the page. It&#39;s important to note that <code>find</code> only returns all of the documents in the collection because we have not specified any search parameters - effectively marking all documents as acceptable for return. Neat!</p>
<p>Next, let&#39;s return a specific document from the database, using the <code>_id</code> field in the document to identify it. Remember, this id is unique and only one document in the collection will match this query. See if you understand the code below.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">router.get(&#39;/:id&#39;, function(req, res) {
db.collection(&#39;notes&#39;).findOne({ _id: ObjectID(req.params.id) }, function(err, note) {
if (err || !note) {
req.session.message = &#39;That note does not exist!&#39;;
return res.redirect(&#39;/&#39;);
}

return.res.render(&#39;note&#39;, {
note: note
})
});
});
</code></pre>
<p>Before we do anything else, we&#39;ll briefly need to make a change in <code>index.hjs</code>. Before, we were using the <code>id</code> field for each note, but if you recall from before, MongoDB stores them in a field called <code>_id</code>. We&#39;ll need to change this in our links to be able to have them correctly send the user to the page for a given note. So let&#39;s change the section for the notes to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">{{#notes}}
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;/{{ _id }}&#39;&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we can retrieve data from the database, let&#39;s also add new data to it! Let&#39;s go back to <code>routes.js</code> and change the final route. Using the <code>insert</code> method, we can quickly and easily add a new JSON document to the <code>notes</code> collection:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">router.post(&#39;/create&#39;, function(req, res) {
if (!(req.body.title &amp;&amp; req.body.body)) {
req.session.message = &#39;You must provide a title and a body!&#39;;
return res.redirect(&#39;/&#39;);
}

db.collection(&#39;notes&#39;).insert({
title: req.body.title,
body: req.body.body
}, function(err, result) {
req.session.message = &#39;Note created!&#39;;
return res.redirect(&#39;/&#39;);
});
});

module.exports = router;
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that wasn&#39;t so bad! In summary: every call to the database involves referencing our middleware <code>req.db</code> and using the collection (aka database) called &#39;notes&#39;. We then use different functions like <code>findOne</code>, that finds one result, or <code>find().toArray</code> that gives us an array of all results in the databse. These functions also have callbacks that specify what to do in case there&#39;s an error, and if not, what to actually do with the result(s) we get. Who know switching storage stage could be that easy?</p>
