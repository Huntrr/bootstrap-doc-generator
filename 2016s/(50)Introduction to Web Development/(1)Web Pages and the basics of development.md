Welcome to your first coding experience!

We'll be going over quite a few things in this opening workshop:

- [How to search effectively using Google + Using Stack Overflow](#an-introduction-to-the-life-of-a-developer)
- [How the internet works and why web development is so different from, say, Java](#an-introduction-to-the-web)
- [Basic HTML and CSS and how webpages are structured](#simple-html-and-css)
- [Javascript, JSON and how to make things more fun](#javascript-finally)
- [The basics of Terminal/Command Prompt](#what-is-terminalcommand-prompt)

This shouldn't take too long though, so whatever time we have left at the end of the workshop will be for you to make your own personal chat app!

Alright, let's get started!
