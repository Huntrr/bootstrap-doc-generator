Before we go into the details of accessing data stored in the database, let's first understand *how* it's stored. Within a single MongoDB instance (like the one we fired up with the `mongod` command), it's possible to create and work with several databases. Within each of these these databases, we store data in *collections*. Each database holds a set of collections, which in turn store documents. Now, the documents are what we are already familiar with: JSON! In order to uniquely identify each of these documents, Mongo automatically generates a field, `_id`, populated with an *ObjectId*. We can find specific documents using either this field, or any other, by generating a search query. (You can also explicitly set the `_id` field if you'd like, although this isn't need in most cases)

Just to get this structure down, let's consider how Twitter data stored in Mongo might look. If we wanted to find the top most trending hashtag in the United States, we'd have to look in the ```tweets``` database, inside the ```trending_hashtags``` collection. Within this collection there are undoubtedly hundreds of documents representing trending tweets in each country, and so we make a query to search for a Document with a field ```country: 'United States'```. Like magic, Mongo will return us this document and we can parse it to find a list of hashtags trending in the country, and subsequently the topmost one.

It's an incredibly powerful method of storing and accessing your data and it often turns out to be suprisingly efficient as well.
