Just type in `mongod` into Terminal before you run your node app. On Windows, you might need to find and double-click the mongod.exe file (it\s probably at `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\bin\mongod.exe`). This fires up a Mongo instance that will run continously in the background until it's killed. You only have to run this once to access Mongo databases on your local machine, from any application you make!
