APIs are basically ways to interact with, or access data, on other parts of the internet that are not our own website. So we can make requests of the Rotten Tomatoes API to pull movie information into our website, or use the Facebook API to let people login and import their credentials to our website. For this workshop we're going to be using the Venmo API to send payments to our friends.
