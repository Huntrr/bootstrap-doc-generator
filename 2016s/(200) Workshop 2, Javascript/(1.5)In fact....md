Javascript is a very easy language to pick up. There are no types, Javascript just guesses (mostly well) what you want. This means that writing `var x = 5` will create a variable named `x` of the type *Integer* with the value of `5`. Writing `var x = "5"` would create a *String* named `x` with the string `5` as its value.

The most common types we will use are Strings (just text, such as "This is some text"), Integers (just plain old numbers, like 5, 6, 42, or 314596 - no decimal points though), Doubles (decimal points are now allowed, so 3.14 is good to go) and Booleans (True or False). There are a whole bunch of functions and operators built into Javascript that we can use on these data-types. You should search for them as and when you need to do something that you think is fairly common (you'll be surprised by how common almost everything you want to do is).

Here's some sample Javascript code:

```javascript
var myVariable = "Code Weekend";
alert ("I'm learning the basics of JavaScript at " + myVariable);
```

This creates an alert (a pop-up on a webpage) that says "I'm learning the basics of JavaScript at Code Weekend". There was absolutely no reason to use a variable here other than to show how we can use it. Here's a function in Javascript that squares a number:

```javascript
function square (number) {
  return number * number;
}

// This is a single line comment that does not need to be closed.

/* This is a multi-line comment
that only ends when we do this */

console.log(square (5)); // This prints the result to the javascript console in your browser's (Chrome or Firefox) developer tools.

// We can also write the above function as the following:
var square = function (number) {
  return number * number;
}

// Here's an anonymous function that calculates the square of 5:
(function (number) {
  return number*number;
}) (5);

// In that case, we were executing the anonymous function immediately, but we don't have to always do that:
function idPlusString (number) {
  var cube = number * number * number;
  return function (name) {
    return "Hi "+ name + ". " + "Your ID is " + cube + ".";
  }
}
// This returns a function that you can add a string to. If you don't understand this last function, it's okay.
```

Javascript mainly works on Objects and Arrays to store and access data.

```javascript
// Here's an Object that contains an array
var myDetails = {
  'name' : "Mark Gates",
  'age' : 24,
  'interests': ['Figure Skating', 'Javascript', 'Tennis', 'EDM']
}

console.log(myDetails.name); // prints the name property of the object, ie, 'Mark Gates'

console.log(myDetails.interests[1]); // prints 'Javascript' (array positions start from 0!) to the console
```

Objects are essentially key-value pairs. We can access to values easily using the notation `object.key`.

If you haven't noticed yet, we end almost every line (or more specifically, every command) with a semicolon. It's okay if you end every line with one, it's better to err on the side of more rather than less, but you can get away with leaving off the semicolons after function definitions and pretty much everything that ends in curly braces (`}`).

*JSON (Javascript Object Notation)* is the data format of the internet. This is what is used to send data that is not HTML/CSS/JS across the internet. That could range from search results to login sessions. Another commonly used format is XML, but that is slowly being replaced everywhere by JSON. JSON is very simple to understand because every JSON file is simply one Javascript Object. It uses key-value pairs and Arrays to liberally to store information. Let's look at an example of a JSON file:

```json
{
  "employees":[
    {
      "firstName":"John", 
      "lastName":"Doe"
    }, 
    {
      "firstName":"Anna", 
      "lastName":"Smith"
    },
    {
      "firstName":"Peter", 
      "lastName":"Jones"
    }
  ],
  "company" : "ABC Holdings",
  "lastUpdated" : "September 6th"
}
```

It's exactly like a Javascript Object, and that's because that's exactly what it is. Just for kicks, let's compare this to XML:

```xml
<employees>
  <employee>
    <firstName>John</firstName> 
    <lastName>Doe</lastName>
  </employee>
  <employee>
    <firstName>Anna</firstName> 
    <lastName>Smith</lastName>
  </employee>
  <employee>
    <firstName>Peter</firstName> 
    <lastName>Jones</lastName>
  </employee>
</employees>
<company>ABC Holdings</company>
<lastUpdated>September 6th</lastUpdated>
```

So much better isn't it! JSON is way more readable and saves you the trouble of having to close every tag you open. Now imagine this on the scale of thousands of search results. JSON makes your life much easier, and websites much faster.

And that covers the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Naturally, there's a lot more we could go into depth about for each of them, but we've found that it's best to learn by experimenting and trying out things on your own, using the resources listed at the start of this session. But before we get to that, let's not forget the pertinent question:
