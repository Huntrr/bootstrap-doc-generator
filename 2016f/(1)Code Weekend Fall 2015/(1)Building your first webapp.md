 [In case you haven't already, sign up for the Fall 2015 workshops here!](http://goo.gl/forms/0lg3QIwvMB)

Code Weekend is scheduled for *August 29 and 30th, 2015* and will comprise of four workshops to help participants build their very own webapp. Participants are expected to have very minimal coding experience as we will be carefully explaining everything we do as we go. This should be extremely helpful to first time hackers (a fun term we use for people that build things!) especially with [PennApps](http://pennapps.com "PennApps XII") scheduled for the weekend after. If you haven't already, check it out - it's a great way to jump in the deep end and expose yourself to the incredible world of building things (and actually they're doing great stuff for first-time hackers as well).

> These workshops have been organized by the Dining Philosophers, PennApps and many talented individuals. Student mentors will be around to help participants as we go through these highly interactive, live-coding-based workshops.

If you already have some coding experience, then feel free to skip the first session. Here's what we expect you to know and have installed before you jump into the second session:

- The basics of how the web works.
- HTML/CSS/Javascript to the extent that you can build a simple static webpage.
- Know how to use Terminal/Command Prompt to move folders, change directories, and create files.

> You can find the workshops from the last Code Weekend (Spring 2015) [here](past/spring15/index.html).
