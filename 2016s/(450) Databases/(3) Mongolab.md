Head out to Mongolab [here](https://mongolab.com/) and create a new account. Mongolab is one of the many platforms that will allow  you to have a database in the cloud -- except here it is free for little projects such as this! Once you have created an account and verified your email address, you shoud be able to create a new Mongo instance. You can create an instance on Windows Azure, AWS, etc. which are various cloud platforms. Go ahead and create a single node on any of these platforms, though I would recommend using Azure for speed. You can name the database anything you would like.

Once you have created the instance, you will need to create a database user. This will allow you to access the database using the standard Mongo URI. For more details about what a URI is you can find info [here](https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.0/reference/connection-string/). This will be an option once you select the database. Once you've created the user, the URI is mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds056698.mongolab.com:56698/<accountname>. We will discuss how the URI will be used later.
