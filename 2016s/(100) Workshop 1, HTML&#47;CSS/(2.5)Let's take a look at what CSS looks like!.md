```css
body {
  padding: 50px 100px;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 40px;
  font-weight: lighter;
  color: blue;
}

.red-text {
  color: red;
}

#intro-para {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

As you can see, there are small differences in syntax depending on the selector (whether you're changing all instances of an element, instances of a class, or just a single element by ID) but it's mostly quite simple.

You should look through the resources at the top of this section for more information on HTML tags and CSS attributes, but the best thing to do is to Google things you're looking to do and look for the [W3C Schools](http://www.w3schools.com) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) results.

You can download the [HTML](assets/files/sample.html) and [CSS](assets/files/main.css) files we looked at here by following these links.

A great way to play around with CSS styles is to right-click on this page in Chrome, Firefox or Safari ([Here's why you should avoid Internet Explorer](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/32372/htg-explains-why-do-so-many-geeks-hate-internet-explorer/)), choose Inspect Element, and try changing the CSS styles on the right hand side of the Developer Tools window after selecting the HTML element you want to edit.
