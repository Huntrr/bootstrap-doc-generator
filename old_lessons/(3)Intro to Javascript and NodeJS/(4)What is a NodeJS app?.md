Node is a very common JavaScript-based web framework. Node is a framework that lets us write our own servers in JavaScript to run on our machines. Node is great because it has *modules*, which are bits of code other people have already written that can easily be added to give new functionality to your app. NodeJS has the most modules of most modern web frameworks, and that's part of what makes it really great for writing webapps fast.
